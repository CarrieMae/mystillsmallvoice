                        <p class="mbr-text_2 mbr-fonts-style display-7">I’ll never forget my first day in the OR. Picture me: fresh scrubs, cap on, clutching a pack of papers like my life depended on it. My new manager, Cassie, led me through the maze of hallways and supply rooms, introducing me to a sea of faces I immediately forgot. I was equal parts excited and terrified, eager to dive into surgery—something I’d loved during nursing school.<br><br>As we finally approached one of the operating rooms, Cassie turned to me and asked, “Are you ready?” I nodded. We slipped on our face masks, and she cracked the door open. Instantly, I was hit with the sound of beeping monitors and the controlled chaos of a surgical team mid-procedure. Cassie leaned in and whispered, “Welcome to the OR.” I was in awe.<br><br>The sheer scale of it all was overwhelming: rows of instruments, aisles of supplies, and endless sutures. I quickly realized this was a completely different world from my old med-surg floor. It felt like starting over—learning everything from scratch. My preceptors filled my head with information faster than I could process it, and it was clear I had a lot to learn.<br><br>At first, I took what I now call useless notes. They were full of details I thought were critical, only to cringe at them years later. But those notes were my lifeline in the beginning. I was terrified of failing—afraid of the surgeons, the scrub techs, and even my own shadow. Slowly, though, things started to click. I figured out the basics: how to set up a room, prep the patient, count supplies, and keep track of a million little details. But just when I thought I had it down, I’d learn that no two surgeons do the same procedure the same way.<br><br><strong>From Rookie to Robotic Team</strong><br>After months of feeling like I was drowning, I started gaining confidence. My notes got better, I made fewer mistakes (and never repeated the same one twice), and I even started preparing for surgeries the night before. Eventually, I was invited to join the robot team—a big deal in our OR, especially for a newbie. I thought, Why me? But I dove in headfirst, studying like it was finals week in nursing school.<br><br>My first assigned surgeon was Dr. Grumble. Let me tell you, this guy was intimidating. His cases were complex and varied, which meant I never knew what to expect. I got my butt kicked in the beginning, but with help from my amazing team (shoutout to Master Lee, the Yoda of our OR), I started nailing it. Now, Dr. Grumble is my favorite surgeon to work with—go figure.<br><br><strong>Building a Home in the OR</strong><br>Over time, I found my rhythm. I made friends with the anesthesia techs and pestered them to teach me everything about their gear. I bonded with Charlie Bennett, my work husband and ultimate partner-in-crime. We’d wait for each other after shifts, swap treats, gossip, and commiserate over the latest OR drama. It felt like I’d finally found my place.<br><br>And then came the pranks. The quiet, shy nurse who was afraid of her own shadow? She’s now the one cracking jokes with surgeons and pranking them during procedures (don’t worry, it’s all in good fun). The OR became a second home, filled with camaraderie, laughter, and a whole lot of learning.<br><br><strong>So, What Does an OR Nurse Actually Do?</strong><br>I start my day in street clothes but quickly switch into scrubs provided by the hospital (lint-free and very chic). I check my assignment, which could be anything from one massive case to six smaller ones. My first task is to dust everything (we don’t do grime in the OR). Then I grab supplies, set up the room, and prepare the sterile field.<br><br>Once the patient arrives, it’s game on. I verify their identity about a hundred times (because you really don’t want to get that wrong). I help anesthesia put the patient to sleep, position them carefully, and prep the surgical site. Once the surgeon scrubs in, we’re off to the races. I make sure they have everything they need, from instruments to suction tubes, and I chart like my fingers are on fire.<br><br>Throughout the surgery, I’m a mix of runner, problem-solver, and equipment-whisperer. I never sit down—not because I’m a hero, but because I’d rather be ready to grab whatever the team needs than be caught slacking off. When the case wraps up, I help transfer the patient to recovery and get the room ready to do it all over again.<br><br><strong>Finding My Groove</strong><br>These days, I’m even learning to scrub in—a whole new challenge that’s brought me closer to my favorite surgeons, including Dr. Wells and Dr. Walker. I never imagined I’d be here, talking and laughing with the same people who once terrified me. It’s been a wild ride, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything. The OR has become my happy place, where I get to learn, grow, and surprise people with just how devious I can be.<br><br>P.S. This story is from a few years back when I was still finding my footing in the OR. These days, I’ve got even more wild stories up my sleeve—like the time I accidentally ended up on a trauma call list. Stay tuned for those!<br><br></p>
